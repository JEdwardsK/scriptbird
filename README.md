# scriptbird
A place for storing one-off scripts. The repo name is a play on [scrubbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_scrubbird).

Run these scripts in Anhinga's flask shell. See Anhinga's [README](https://github.com/Feathr/anhinga#running-commands-in-the-running-container) for starting a shell session.
